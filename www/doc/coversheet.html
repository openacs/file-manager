<h3>I. The Big Picture: </h3>

<p>The ACS File Manager is a simple tool that allows content managers
to work on a site even if they don't have access to the machine on which it
runs, via FTP or SSH login. Through the File Manager's Web-based user
interface, text files can be edited using HTML forms, and new versions
of binary files like images can be uploaded, to replace prior
versions.  The set of files and directories that content managers are
allowed to work on can be configured in the parameters file.  If your
site uses version control, then File Manager will also take care of
recording all changes in the version control system.
