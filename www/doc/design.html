<h3>II.  Introduction: </h3>

The ACS File Manager is a simple tool that allows content managers to
work on a site even if they don't have access to the machine on which
it runs via FTP or SSH login. Through the File Manager's Web-based
user interface, text files can be edited using HTML forms and new
versions of binary files - such as image files - can be uploaded,
replacing prior versions.  If your site uses version control, then
File Manager will also take care of recording all changes in the
version control system.  In addition to editing existing files,
content managers can also add new files to the system and create
directories. <p>

<h3>III. Historical Considerations </h3>

In order that the File Manager application integrate properly in a
professional development environment, provisions had to be made to
ensure that version control constraints be respected and file access
permissions be configurable at a high degree of specificity.

<h3>IV. Competitive Analysis </h3>

<p>The ACS File Manager is a lightweight content management tool.  It
provides the mimimal functionality necessary for non-programmers to
work on a site.  It's main limitations are fine-grain access control
and access to the full revision history of an item.

<h3>V.  Design tradeoffs</h3>

Keep in mind that all file operations (uploads, edits, creating
directories, etc.) are executed by the running AOLserver process. This
means that permissions are determined by the umask of the
corresponding account, usually nsadmin. As a minor security check,
File Manager does not allow file names with /'s, spaces or &'s, making
it more difficult for users to create files outside of the server's
pageroot. <p>

<h3>VI. Data Model</h3>

The File Manager application has no data model.

<h3>VII. Legal transactions</h3>

The File Manager application has no data model and hence no legal
transactions with the database.

<h3>VIII. API </h3>

File Manager is fully integrated with CVS (the version control
system used by all ArsDigita development projects).  All CVS
transactions are handled by the <a href=/doc/version-control>version
control</a> application.  If you want to use version control in conjunction
with a remote repository, make sure you follow the instructions for
setting up access to a remote repository.<p>

<h3>IX. User Interface</h3>

<p>The user interface looks like a file browser.  It uses the following
icons to indicate file status and type for various items under the
server's pageroot:</p>  

<blockquote>
<table>

<tr>
<td><img src=pics/folder.gif></td>
<td>Folder</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src=pics/text.gif></td>
<td>Editable text file</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src=pics/image.gif></td>
<td>Editable image file</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src=pics/locked.gif></td>
<td>Locked file, e.g. a file under version control with local
modifications</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src=pics/forbidden.gif></td>
<td>Forbidden file that cannot be edited or uploaded using File
Manager</td>
</tr>

</table>
</blockquote>

<p>You can click on text or image file icons to see a preview of the
item, and you can click on file names to edit or upload new content.
Clicking on a folder will navigate to that directory and display its
contents.  Forbidden files cannot be operated on.

<h3>X.  Configuration parameters</h3>

The set of files and directories that content managers are allowed to
work on can be configured in the parameters file.  The following set of parameters control the behavior of File
Manager:

<blockquote>
<pre>
[ns/server/yourservername/acs/file-manager]
EnabledP=1
; use version control?
VersionControlP=1
; extensions of files that be can edited/uploaded using File Manager
Extensions=html,adp,jpg,gif
; directories to ignore
Ignore=admin,CVS
; directories to manage (relative to www)
ManagedDirectories=acs-examples,ads,graphics
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The <code>VersionControlP</code> flag controls whether the version
control application should be used to record all changes to files.
The <code>Extensions</code> parameter is a list of file extensions
that correspond to editable files.  The <code>Ignore</code> parameter
lists directory names that should never appear in the file
listing. The <code>ManagedDirectories</code> parameter controls which
directories will be accessible via file-manager.  If you leave this
parameter out then all directories will be available.</p>

<h3>XI. Acceptance tests</h3>

<p>You should test adding and editing a file:

<ul>
<li>Verify that file-manager is enabled in the ACS initialization
file
<li>Go to /admin/file-manager/ and select a directory
<li>Add a file to the directory from your computer
<li>Edit the contents of the file
<li>Click the preview icon to verify the contents of the file
</ul>

<h3>XII. Future Improvements/Areas of Likely Change</h3>

The ability to delete, rename, and move files and directories would be
nice.  It would also be nice to have a fixed set of permissions from
which to choose when constraining file access for different user groups.<p>
