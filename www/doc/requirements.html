<h3>I. Introduction</h3>

The following is a requirements document for the ACS File Manager application.

<h3>II. Vision Statement</h3>

Content managers often need to be able to work on a site without
having access to or the knowledge to interface with such file-transfer
programs as FTP, SCP, and the like.  The File Manager application
will provide a Web-based user interface for uploading and editing text
files and for uploading binary image and program files.  It will
integrate with our current permissioning system and shall be fully CVS
compliant so as to allow proper version control tracking for all file
system changes.<p>

<h3>III. System/Application Overview</h3>

The File Manager system will emulate a file browser by using icons to
indicate file status and type for each file handled by the system.
The file types to be covered are: editable (text) file, editable
(image) file, folder, locked file, and forbidden file.  <p>

<h3>IV. Use-cases and User-scenarios</h3>

<p>File Manager users will typically be HTML designers, graphic
artists, and content editors who oversee text and graphics displayed
on the site.  All users of the system must have site-wide
administration privileges.

<h3>VI.A Requirements: Data Model</h3>

The File Manager application has no associated data model.

<h3>VI.B Requirements: User-Level Requirements </h3>

<ul>
<li><b>20.10</b> User level functionality<p>
    <b>20.10.10</b> Users can upload text or binary files <p>
    <b>20.10.20</b> Users can edit text files via HTML forms<p>
    <b>20.10.30</b> Users cannot gain access to locked files, i.e.,
    files under version control that have undergone local modification<p>
    <b>20.10.40</b> Users cannot overwrite or edit files outside of
    their permission level<p>
    <b>20.10.50</b> Users can click on a text or image file to see a
    preview of that item<p>
    <b>20.10.60</b> Users can click on file names to edit or upload
    new content<p>
    <b>20.10.70</b> Users can navigate within directory structure by
    clicking on folder icons, as in a file browser.<p>
</ul>

<h3>VI.C Requirements: Version Control </h3>

<ul>
<li><b>30.10</b> Version Control <p>
    <b>30.10.10</b> Application should be fully integrated with CVS<p>
    <b>30.10.20</b> Application should allow the Version Control
    application to handle all CVS transactions.<p>
    <b>30.10.30</b> Application should provide a method for using
    version control in conjunction with a remote repository.<p>
</ul>

<h3>VI.D Requirements: Permissions </h3>

<ul>
<li><b>40.10</b> Permissioning<p>
    <b>40.10.10</b> Permissions should be determined by the umask of
    the AOL account corresponding to the currently running AOLserver
    process.<p>
    <b>40.10.20</b> Application should not allow file names with "/"'s
    or spaces, so as to make it more difficult for users to create
    files outside of the server's pageroot.<p>
</ul>

<h3>VI.E Requirements: Configurable Behavior </h3>

<ul>
<li><b>50.10</b> Parameters<p>
    <b>50.10.10</b> Application should allow on/off toggling of version
    control<p>
    <b>50.10.20</b> Application should allow specification of which
    file types can be edited through the system<p>
    <b>50.10.30</b> Application should be able to mask certain
    directories from user<p>
    <b>50.10.40</b> Directories to be managed should be prespecifiable
    in the parameters file<p>
</ul>

<h3>VII. Implementation Notes</h3>

The behavior of the File Manager application should be configurable
via a set of parameters indicating: whether or not version control is
to be enabled, any salient version control parameters if so, and those
directories accessible via File Manager.<p>
